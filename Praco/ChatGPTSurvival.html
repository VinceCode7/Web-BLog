<h2>Will ChatGPT survive 2026? Some are bidding farewell to OpenAI</h2>
<img src="images/ChatGPT.png" alt="A picture of ChatGPT ICON">
With the introduction of adverts in ChatGPT and a <b>$134 billion</b> lawsuit from Elon Musk, OpenAI may run out of money in the next 18 months or sooner.<br><br>
​After months of speculation, OpenAI officially confirmed in early January that it plans to start testing ads in the US for the ChatGPT Free and Go tiers.<br><br>
The company explained that <mark>ads will not influence the chatbot's answers,</mark> but will be “separate and clearly labelled,” addressing concerns that ads could be woven into regular ChatGPT conversations.<br><br>
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has previously called ads in ChatGPT “the last resort” for the company, describing the blend of advertising and artificial intelligence (AI) as “sort of uniquely unsettling.”<br><br>
The same day, Musk filed a court action seeking between $79 billion and $134 billion in damages for the wrongful gains OpenAI and Microsoft have earned. Musk says he was defrauded of the $38 million in seed funding he provided to the company in 2015.<br><br>
The ad introduction and Musk’s court filing raised questions about the future of OpenAI, which generates significant revenue but has not turned a profit.<br><br>
Luiza Jarovsky, the CEO of the AI, Tech & Privacy Academy, has predicted that the company might not survive 2026, describing Musk’s court filing as “the most catastrophic development” for OpenAI.<br><br>
“Meanwhile, the low-profile, low-drama Google and Anthropic rejoice with every new court filing against OpenAI and quietly hope for its death by a thousand cuts,” Jarovsky wrote on X.<br><br>
While ChatGPT remains the most used chatbot in the world, Google Gemini's explosive growth has outpaced ChatGPT’s in late 2025, prompting Altman to declare a “code red” and delay the ad rollout
