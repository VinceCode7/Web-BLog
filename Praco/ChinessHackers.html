        <h2>Chinese Hackers Use Anthropic's AI to Launch Automated Cyber Espionage Campaign</h2>
        <img src="images\chinaAIHack.png" alt="a Rob Ai operating a computer" >
       <br><br> "The attackers used AI's 'agentic' capabilities to an unprecedented degree – using AI not just as an advisor, but to <mark>execute the cyber attacks themselves</mark>," the AI upstart said
        The activity is assessed to have manipulated <b>Claude Code</b>, Anthropic's AI coding tool, to attempt to break into about 30 global targets spanning large tech companies, financial 
        institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. A subset of these intrusions succeeded. Anthropic has since banned the relevant accounts and enforced 
        defensive mechanisms to flag such attacks.<br><br>
        The campaign, <i>GTG-1002</i>, marks the first time a threat actor has leveraged AI to conduct a "large-scale cyber attack" without major human intervention and for intelligence 
        collection by striking high-value targets, indicating continued evolution in adversarial use of the technology.<br><br>
        Describing the operation as well-resourced and professionally coordinated, Anthropic said the threat actor turned Claude into an "autonomous cyber attack agent" to support 
        various stages of the attack lifecycle, including <mark>reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, lateral movement, credential harvesting, data analysis, and exfiltration</mark>.<br><br>
        Specifically, it involved the use of Claude Code and Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, with the former acting as the central nervous system to process the human operators' instructions
         and break down the multi-stage attack into small technical tasks that can be offloaded to sub-agents.
