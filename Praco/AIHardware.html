            Maybe the $6.4 billion that OpenAI spent on Jony Ive’s company was money well spent after all.<br><br>
            More details are emerging around the launch of OpenAI’s new device.<br><br>
            The company’s Chief Global Officer, Chris Lehane, revealed that its first hardware device should be revealed in the second half of 2026.<br><br>
            The information was shared during an Axios event in Davos, Switzerland, according to TechCrunch.<br><br>
            Despite learning when the company may release its device, Lehane didn’t reveal what kind of device it might be.<br><br>
            It was previously reported that the company won’t be creating a wearable or in-ear device. The company also hinted that it was leaning towards creating a pocket-sized device without a screen.<br><br>
            The user notes that the device may be introduced in September, with estimated shipments expected to reach 40 to 50 million units.<br><br>
            A Taiwanese newspaper has also reported that the device would be manufactured by Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer.<br><br>
            The news about OpenAI shifting to hardware development came after it struck a deal with Jony Ive, Apple’s ex-chief design officer and the co-founder of an AI company that the ChatGPT creator acquired last year for approximately $6.4 billion.<br><br>
