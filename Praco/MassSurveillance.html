            <h2>Mass surveillance has become the norm, Signal CEO warns</h2>

            Why do we give a handful of tech companies so much power over our privacy? Privacy isn’t a luxury, but a fundamental human right. To keep it that way, we need a different ecosystem within which to build our core technical infrastructure that respects our right to privacy.<br><br>
            That’s what Meredith Whittaker, CEO of message platform Signal, says in an interview with Dutch news outlet VPRO Tegenlicht.<br><br>
            Privacy is for those who have something to hide, a lot of tech companies and governments seem to think nowadays. In reality, it’s the ad industry that wants to keep its hands on the steering wheel as much and as long as possible, profiting as much as it can from data collection.<br><br>
            Know-your-customer policies, originally implemented to detect fraud and combat financing of terrorism, have only incentivized the collection of as much personal information of people as humanly possible.<br><br>
            If you have nothing to hide, then why are you so concerned about your privacy? It’s an argument that’s been voiced frequently over recent years, primarily by tech companies, political entities, and intelligence agencies all over the world.<br><br>
            Meredith counters that argument with a simple thought experiment.<br><br>
            “Imagine every DM you’ve ever sent, every heart you’ve ever put on some Instagram baddy’s story, every Grindr swipe you’ve ever done, every weird little message you’ve sent to your friend, everything you’ve ever said to your coworker over text. 
            Everything you’ve ever sent is dumped in a database (…) What would you be willing to do to prevent that information from being sent to all of your loved ones?” Whittaker wondered out loud.<br><br>
