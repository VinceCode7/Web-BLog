            <h2>French regulator fines company €3.5M over data sharing and tracking cookies</h2>
            <img src="images/FrenchCookies.png" alt="A picture of France flag upside down with cookies at the botton">
            The French data protection and privacy regulator has fined an unnamed company €3.5 million for sharing customer data with a social media platform without consent, allowing users to create weak passwords, using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, and installing tracking cookies without consent.<br><br>
            According to the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), the unnamed company has been sharing the email addresses and telephone numbers of its loyalty program members on a social networking platform since February 2018. This information was used to show personalized ads promoting items sold by the company.<br><br>
            However, customers were not informed about the data transfer or its purpose, which constitutes a violation of Articles 12 and 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<br><br>
            On top of that, the company failed to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) before processing and sharing this data with the social network, in violation of Article 35 of the GDPR.<br><br>
            Furthermore, the CNIL noted that the company allowed users to implement user account passwords that were “insufficiently robust.”<br><br>
            Also, the company used the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which, according to the French DPA, didn’t allow secure storage of passwords. This is an infringement of Article 32 of the GDPR, which handles the security of processing personal information.<br><br>
