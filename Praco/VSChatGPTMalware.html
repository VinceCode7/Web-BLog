            A massive file harvesting campaign is ongoing, targeting VS Code developers. Over 1.5 million users have downloaded knock-off extensions that function like AI coding assistants but are also bristling with spyware.<br><br>
            KOI Security researchers warn that searching for the “ChatGPT” extension on the VS Code Marketplace too often leads to spyware infections.<br><br>
            Over 1.5 million developers have already installed two extensions that mimic AI assistants and actually deliver the promised functionality. However, they take longer than any user might expect.<br><br>
            “These extensions actually work. That's what makes them dangerous,” KOI Security said in a report on AI extensions leaking data from developers.<br><br>
            “Both are marketed as AI coding assistants. Both are functional. Both contain identical malicious code – the same spyware infrastructure running under different publisher names.”<br><br>
            One of the extensions, called “ChatGPT - 中文版,” has 1.35 million installs. Another AI tool, “ChatGPT - ChatMoss,” has attracted 150,000 users.<br><br>
            Not only are both extensions still available on the VS Code marketplace at the time of writing, but they also appear among the top results when searching for ChatGPT. There are also many more dubious knockoffs, wrappers, and alternatives.<br><br>
            What’s wrong with the two extensions?<br><br>
            They capture every file the users open, every edit they make, and send the data to servers in China.<br><br>
            “Both contain identical malicious code – the same spyware infrastructure running under different publisher names.”<br><br>
