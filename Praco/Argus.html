            <h2>Argus – Python-powered Toolkit for Information Gathering and Reconnaissance</h2>
             <img src="images/argusTool.png" alt="A picture of argus interface running on kali linux terminal">
            Argus is a <mark>comprehensive Python-based toolkit</mark> designed for reconnaissance tasks in cybersecurity. The developers recently released version 2.0, expanding it to include <b>135 modules</b>.<br><br>
            This tool consolidates <b>network analysis, web app scanning, and threat intelligence</b> into one interface. Users access modules through an interactive CLI that supports searching, favorites, and batch runs. Network and infrastructure modules cover DNS records, open ports, SSL chain analysis, and traceroute from 1 to 52.
            <br>Web application analysis spans 53 to 102, including CMS detection, content discovery, JavaScript analyzers, and CORS scanners. Security and threat intelligence modules, numbered 103 to 135, handle Shodan queries, VirusTotal scans, subdomain takeovers, and cloud exposure checks.
            Profiles like “speed” or “deep” adjust thread counts and timeouts for different scan intensities.<br>
            Security experts praise its breadth for red teaming and OSINT, reducing tool sprawl. Always obtain permission; the tool includes a legal disclaimer against misuse. Argus simplifies recon workflows for pentesters and analysts.<br>
