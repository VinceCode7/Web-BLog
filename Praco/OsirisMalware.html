            <h2>New Osiris Ransomware Using Wide Range of Living off the Land and Dual-use Tools in Attacks</h2>
           <img src="images/OsirisMalware.png" alt="A picture of a padlock with a label written ransomware">
            A newly discovered ransomware family called <i>Osiris</i> launched attacks against a major food service company in Southeast Asia during <b>November 2025</b>.<br><br>
            Security researchers have identified this threat as a completely new malware variant with no connection to an older ransomware family that shared the same name in 2016.<br><br>
            The emergence of Osiris marks another addition to the growing number of sophisticated encryption threats targeting critical infrastructure and business operations.
            The attack campaign demonstrates advanced tactics commonly associated with experienced threat actors.<br><br>
            Attackers leveraged a <mark>diverse toolkit</mark> combining legitimate system tools with malicious utilities to infiltrate the victim’s network, establish persistence, and deploy the ransomware payload.
            The incident reveals how modern cybercriminals operate by <mark>abusing</mark> everyday <mark>Windows utilities</mark> alongside <b>custom-developed malicious software to avoid detection and bypass security controls</b>.
            Symantec analysts identified the malware after discovering suspicious patterns matching previously documented Inc ransomware campaigns.
            Researchers noted technical overlaps including identical filenames for credential extraction tools and similar data exfiltration methods. The attackers used Rclone to steal data before encryption, uploading stolen information to Wasabi cloud storage buckets.
