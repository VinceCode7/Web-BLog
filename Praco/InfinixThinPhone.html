            <h2>Thinner than iPhone 17 and with an enhanced battery, this Chinese smartphone costs only $200</h2>
            <img src="images/ThinPhone.png" alt="A picture of an Infinix Phone">
            Infinix's latest smartphone comes with a silicone carbon battery and a very reasonable price.<br><br>
            Infinix, a Chinese smartphone company, has released a new smartphone. It’s called the Infinix NOTE Edge, and it will be sold worldwide.<br><br>
            What makes it stand out from other existing smartphones is its quite slim body (7.2 mm thick, while iPhone 17 is around 7.95 mm).<br><br>
            Despite its thinness, the device is equipped with a 6,500 mAh silicone-carbon battery. For comparison, an average smartphone battery is equipped with 3,000 mAh or 5,000 mAh.<br><br>
            Silicon-carbon batteries are often used in flagship smartphones because they can store more energy, last longer, and charge faster.<br><br>
            The device weighs 185 grams and comes with MediaTek’s Dimensity 7100 SoC chip. It also includes a 6.78-inch, 1.5K AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.<br><br>
            When it comes to the smartphone’s design, the device comes in four colors and features a “3D curved” design, which should make it more comfortable to hold.<br><br>
            The smartphone comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage. The NOTE Edge has space for two SIM cards and is installed with Android 16 and XOS 16.<br><br>
