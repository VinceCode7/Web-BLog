    <h2 >India hit by China-linked phishing campaign, unleashes malware to create long-term spy backdoor</h2>
    <img src="images/ChinaToIndia.png" alt="A picture of an asian map with a dragon attacking India">
    A newly-uncovered espionage campaign aimed at targeted individuals is using phishing emails that impersonate the Government of India.
While the campaign uses a well-known banking trojan, it appears that the goal is to establish <b>long-term access to victims’ computers</b> for surveillance and data collection purposes, rather than immediate financial theft.<br><br>
The activity was identified by eSentire’s Threat Response Unit in early December 2025 and begins with messages designed to lure recipients into downloading a malicious archive.<br><br>
The emails appear as penalty notices from the Indian government’s tax office. Once opened, the file triggers a multi-stage infection chain that investigators describe as unusually deliberate and technically mature.<br><br>
The research, authored by cyber security researcher Vishavjit Singh, says the attackers’ main goal is <mark>“persistent, elevated access”</mark> that enables continuous monitoring of a victim’s device, including user activity, file operations and the potential exfiltration of sensitive information.<br><br>
The intrusion starts by abusing a trusted Windows process to hide its entry point. Attackers run a legitimate, signed Microsoft application but “side-load” a malicious file alongside it, piggybacking on to the software that appears safe to the operating system and some security controls.<br><br>
The first-stage loader also performs extensive anti-analysis checks — a common sign, Singh notes, that the bad actor anticipates defenders will investigate.<br><br>
If those checks are passed, the malware calls back to attacker-controlled infrastructure to retrieve a second payload, described as a packed shellcode that unpacks itself in memory to reduce its footprint on disk.<br><br>
From there, it escalates privileges and attempts to blend into normal system behavior.
The report highlights a “file-less COM-based” User Account Control bypass, which is used to grant administrator rights, along with “ process masquerading” that makes the malware resemble Windows explorer.exe in monitoring tools.
