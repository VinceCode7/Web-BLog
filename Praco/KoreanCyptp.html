            <h2>South Korean police admit losing seized bitcoin in phishing scam</h2>
                <img src="images/KoreaCrypto.png" alt="A picture of half pieces half full bitcoin">
        Even law enforcement agencies that are expected to know how to protect themselves from crypto scammers can fall victim to such crimes, as a recent incident in South Korea has shown.<br><br>
        According to multiple local media reports, South Korean police confirmed that they've launched an investigation in an attempt to recover lost bitcoin (BTC). <br><br>
        While official details remain scarce, police reportedly acknowledged that they suffered a phishing attack after a member of their team was tricked into visiting a scam website during a routine check of seized BTC. This reportedly enabled criminals to access sensitive data, which was then allegedly used to steal BTC from a hardware wallet.<br><br>
        Some reports speculate that the scammers may have stolen bitcoin worth between $48 million and $115 million.<br><br>
        The bitcoin was seized from an illegal gambling operator, who was later sentenced to two and a half years in prison.<br><br>
        Meanwhile, as the investigation continues, South Korea has also repatriated 73 suspected scammers from Cambodia for questioning over allegations that they stole approximately $33 million from more than 800 South Koreans, Reuters reported today.<br><br>
        As previously reported, Asia is increasingly becoming a hotspot for crypto scammers targeting victims around the globe. However, each region has its own crypto criminals. For example, the US Department of Justice’s Fraud Section highlighted significant crypto-related cases in its 2025 Year in Review. In one case, a court in November 2025<br><br>
         sentenced a man to 60 months in prison for a $9.4 million investment fraud scheme that victimized approximately 2,800 people. In another case, law enforcement seized more than $7.2 million worth of assets, including crypto assets.<br><br>
