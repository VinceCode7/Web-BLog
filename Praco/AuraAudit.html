<h2>AuraAudit – Open-Source Tool for Salesforce Aura Framework Misconfiguration Analysis</h2>
<img src="images/AuraInspector.png" alt="AuraAudit Running on a CLI ">
Mandiant has released AuraInspector, an open-source command-line tool that helps security defenders identify and audit access-control misconfigurations in the Salesforce Aura framework.<br><br>
The tool addresses a critical security gap in <mark>Salesforce Experience Cloud deployments</mark>, where misconfigurations frequently expose sensitive data, including<b> credit card numbers, identity documents, and health information</b>.<br><br>
The Aura endpoint, a fundamental component of Salesforce’s Lightning Experience interface, is one of the most commonly targeted attack surfaces in Experience Cloud applications.<br><br>
Salesforce’s object sharing rules span multiple configuration levels, making it challenging for administrators to identify potential access-control misconfigurations from an external perspective.<br><br>
AuraInspector automates the detection of these exposures and provides actionable remediation insights.<br><br>
The tool leverages several attack techniques previously documented by Mandiant’s Offensive Security Services team.
It identifies accessible objects via Aura methods such as getItems and getConfigData, which can expose sensitive records when access controls are improperly configured.
