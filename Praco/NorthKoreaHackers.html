            <h2>North Korean Hackers Adopted AI to Generate Malware Attacking Developers and Engineering Teams</h2>
<img src="images\NorthKoreaHackersAi.png" alt="a Rob Ai operating a computer">
         <br>   North Korea–aligned hackers have launched a new campaign that turns artificial intelligence into a weapon against software teams.
Using <b>AI-written PowerShell code</b>, the group known as <mark>KONNI</mark> is delivering a stealthy backdoor that blends real project content with malicious scripts.<br><br>
This operation shows how fast threat actors are adopting AI tools to speed up development and hide their tracks.<br><br>
In the latest wave, KONNI is targeting <b>developers and engineering teams</b> working on <i>blockchain and crypto projects</i> across the Asia‑Pacific region, including <b>Japan, Australia, and India</b>.
The attackers craft detailed requirement papers that look like real product briefs, describing trading bots, credential systems, and delivery roadmaps, then deliver them as <m>DF lures</m>P.<br><br>
These documents are designed to win the trust of technical staff and draw them into opening attached shortcut files that silently start the infection chain.
